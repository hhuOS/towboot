# towboot

a bootloader for Multiboot kernels (version 1 and version 2) on UEFI systems

## usage

towboot is a UEFI application. If you're developing an operating system or just
want to create a boot medium, there are several possible options for where to
place towboot and its configuration:

### removable media

This is the easiest one: It works for all architectures and requires no
configuration of the system.
Simply place the 32-bit build at `\EFI\boot\bootia32.efi`, the 64-bit build at
`\EFI\boot\bootx64.efi` and a configuration file at `\towboot.toml` on the ESP.

You can also use the provided `towbootctl` binary to do this.

```sh
towbootctl install <path_to_the_esp> --removable -- -config towboot.toml
```

This will parse the configuration file and copy the configuration itself,
the referenced kernels and modules and towboot binaries for 32-bit and 64-bit
to the target directory.

### installed system

Place an appropriate build at `\EFI\yourOS\towboot.efi` and the configuration
at `\EFI\yourOS\towboot.toml` on the ESP and add a boot option for
`\EFI\yourOS\towboot.efi -c \EFI\yourOS\towboot.toml`.

towbootctl can help you a bit with this:

```sh
towbootctl install <path_to_the_esp> --name yourOS -- -config towboot.toml
```

(You can also configure towboot just with command line arguments instead of
using a configuration file; see below.)

### image

If you're not installing to physical media but instead want to create an image,
towbootctl can do this as well:

```sh
towbootctl image --target yourOS.img -- -config towboot.toml
towbootctl boot-image --image yourOS.img
```

### chainloading from another bootloader

If you already have a bootloader capable of loading UEFI applications but
without support for Multiboot, you can add an entry like
`towboot.efi -kernel "mykernel.elf quiet" -module "initramfs.img initrd"`.

(You can use a configuration file instead of passing the information directly
on the command line; see above.)

### paths

Paths given in a configuration file or on the command line are interpreted as
follows:
 * absolute if they start with a volume identifier (`fs?:`)
 * relative to the volume towboot itself is on if they start with a backslash (`\`)
 * relative to the configuration file

Paths relative to the UEFI shell's current working directory are not supported, yet.

Paths for kernel and modules given on the commandline can't contain spaces,
use a configuration file for this.

### quirks

You can override some specifics of how the kernel is loaded at runtime by
adding quirks. They can be configured either in the `quirk` key of a kernel
entry (if the kernel is loaded via a configuration file) or via the `-quirk`
command line option (if the kernel is loaded via `-kernel`).

Available quirks are:

* `DontExitBootServices`: do not exit Boot Services
        This starts the kernel with more privileges and less available memory.
        In some cases this might also display more helpful error messages.
* `ForceElf`: always treat the kernel as an ELF file
* `ForceOverwrite`: ignore the memory map when loading the kernel
        (This might damage your hardware!)
* `KeepResolution`: ignore the kernel's preferred resolution
* `ModulesBelow200Mb`: keep allocations for modules below 200 MB

## development

If you want to compile towboot yourself, here are the instructions:

### dependencies

You'll need a nightly Rust compiler.
The version doesn't really matter,
though `1.88.0-nightly (d6c1e454a 2025-04-21)` definitely works.
If you don't know how to install one,
please take a look at [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).

To boot the disk image in a virtual machine, QEMU is recommended.
You'll need OVMF for that, too, but the build script downloads it by itself.

### building

```sh
cargo build --package towboot
```

creates a `towboot.efi` file inside the `target` folder.
By default, this is a debug build for `i686-unknown-uefi`.
You can change this by appending `--release`
or by setting `--target x86_64_unknown_uefi` (for example).

Running `cargo xtask build` will do that and also create a disk image,
so just may just want to run this. To boot the resulting image with QEMU,
you can use `cargo xtask boot-image`.

You can configure whether to create a `debug` or `release` build for
either `i686` or `x86_64`, whether to enable KVM or wait for a GDB to attach
by specifying command line options.

You can also run towbootctl directly from the source directory (building it will
also build towboot, in turn):

```sh
cargo run --package towbootctl --features binary
```

### running the tests

The integration tests can be run with:

```sh
cargo test --package tests
```

## project structure

This project is a Cargo workspace consisting of the multiple packages.
More documentation for each of them is available by running:

```sh
cargo doc --package <package> --open
```

### towboot

This is the actual bootloader.

### towboot_config

This is a library containing the configuration structs.
It is used by towboot and towbootctl.

### towboot_ia32 / towboot_x64

These are dummy crates that just exists to provide the towboot binary in library form.

### towbootctl

This is both a library and a command line utility that can create images,
install towboot to disk, and so on.

### tests

This contains the integration tests.

### xtask

This contains build tooling.
